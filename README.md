# Green Pharmacy
The Green Pharmacy provides opportunities to order drugs in an online format. There are two roles in the program: 1 - Login with administrator rights. 2 - Login under user rights with premature registration in the program. The developed software simplifies the system of ordering drugs and provides an opportunity for the user to choose the desired method of treatment without leaving home.
